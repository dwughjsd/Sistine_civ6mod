[h1]什么是Project Sistine（Dev通道）？[/h1]

Project Sistine是一款制作中的《文明6》中等规模大修mod，意在通过部分引用《文明》系列旧作的内容来提升本游戏的策略深度和可玩性。由于这个作品涉及内容众多，工作量十分巨大，我们决定以公开的测试版招募新的开发人员，并收集早期反馈意见。我们的AI也许是工坊中最擅长科技胜利的——许多时候作弊低于原版的神难度能在240回合内取得胜利，比原版游戏中快超过100回合（而熟练的玩家赢得胜利的时间却比原版更长）！

[h1]在现有的Dev通道中可以玩到什么？[/h1]

Dev通道截至发布时已基本完成了建筑、区域和地形地貌的重做，AI能力的提升和少量新内容。Shimamura et al. 现有的领袖 mod 与本作品不兼容，尽管游戏能够正常进行，但会遇上数值问题。

[h1]下一步计划是什么样的？[/h1]

近期我们将继续以游戏性改动为主，并且仍需要美术、文本、翻译、测试等方面的援助。你们的帮助有助于我们将其改进得更好。

[h1]What is Project Sistine (Dev Channel)?[/h1]

Project Sistine is a medium-scale overhaul mod for Civilization VI under development. This mod aims to partially revive contents from previous titles from Civilization franchise to improve strategic depth and gameplay of this game. Since this mod is a massive project and needs a lot of work, we decided to release a public test version to attract new developers and collect early feedback of this mod. We provide maybe the best AI in pursuing a Science Victory - it's not hard to see them win in 240 turns at Deity difficulty WITH LESS CHEATING, which means they are >100 turns faster than vanilla AI (while expert players are slowed down)!

[h1]What is available now in Dev Channel?[/h1]

The Dev channel includes overhaul of buildings, districts, terrains, features, improvements on AI performance and minor new mechanisms. Leader mods by Shimamura et al. are currently incompatible with this mod and will have some gameplay balancing issues, though a complete game can be finished.

[h1]What's the plan of next update?[/h1]

We will continue wokring on gameplay in near future, and your support on arts, text, localization and tesing can definitely help us.
